149	4665	I give the floor to Mr. Tavaresh to move the request, please.
6556	7397	Thank you, President.
7937	15543	Well, some colleagues took the initiative of putting in the agenda an urgency resolution on Brazil's refusal to extradite Cesare Baptista to Italy.
16043	21487	I do understand their motives, but as I shall demonstrate, this is not a present human rights case.
22107	26531	It is not an urgent case, and it is not even a breach of the rule of law case.
27211	33376	Furthermore, it comes at a terrible moment when Brazil is facing the worst natural disaster in its history.
34016	42243	Cesar Abatisi is in prison, is waiting for a decision of the Brazil Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court is in the Holidays of the Southern Hemisphere.
42643	46246	There is no reason to believe that there won't be an independent decision.
46806	56254	I express my solidarity with the families of the victims in this case, and rest assured I have no sympathy towards political violence, either from the right or the left.
56914	64561	But we should use the agencies to debate southern Sudan, the case of Bushar Tabuni in Indonesia, or the Palestinian men shot dead in his bed.
65061	78213	Will the parliament grant President Dilma Rousseff on the very first occasion after her groundbreaking election, and for no sound formal reason, the kind of debate that we usually reserve for people like Mubakabe?
78433	81896	I ask you to remove Brazil from the agenda of the agency.
84468	85489	Thank you very much.
85950	88493	Who would like to speak in favor of this request?
88513	90155	I don't see any comments.
90195	93399	Who wants to speak against this request?
93580	93820	Mr. Mauro.
